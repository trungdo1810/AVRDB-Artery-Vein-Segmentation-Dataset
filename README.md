# AVRDB-AFIO Cleaned Artery/Vein Masks

### üìã Overview

This repository provides **cleaned and standardized artery/vein segmentation masks** derived from the publicly available **AVRDB dataset**
(*AVRDB: Annotated dataset for vessel segmentation and calculation of arteriovenous ratio*).
The annotations were originally provided by the **Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO)**.

The original masks contained non-binary pixel values and near-white or near-red artifacts, which caused difficulties in segmentation training.
I refined and remapped the masks using the following color convention:

| Label      | RGB Color   |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Artery     | (255, 0, 0) |
| Vein       | (0, 0, 255) |
| Crossing   | (0, 255, 0) |
| Background | (0, 0, 0)   |
