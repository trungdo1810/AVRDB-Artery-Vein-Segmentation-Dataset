# AVRDB-AFIO Cleaned Artery/Vein Masks
![Cleaned artery/vein mask samples derived from AVRDB dataset](./samples/stitched_result.jpg)
*Example of refined A/V masks visualization (red: artery, blue: vein, green: crossing).*

### üìã Overview

This repository provides **ready-to-use artery/vein segmentation masks** derived from the publicly available **AVRDB dataset**
(*AVRDB: Annotated dataset for vessel segmentation and calculation of arteriovenous ratio*).
The annotations were originally provided by the **Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO)**.

The original masks contained non-binary pixel values and near-white or near-red artifacts, which caused difficulties in segmentation training.
I refined and remapped the masks using the following color convention:

| Label      | RGB Color   |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Artery     | (255, 0, 0) |
| Vein       | (0, 0, 255) |
| Crossing   | (0, 255, 0) |
| Background | (0, 0, 0)   |
